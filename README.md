# General Social Survey Data and Income

This is pat of an ongoing project where I evaluated the underlying factors of income in the United States using machine learning, primarily mixed-effect modeling.

I modeled data taken from the General Social Survey (GSS) taken by the NORC to find what the most important factors in derermining American income were.

My main experimntation was divided into 3 main parts, with part 0 simply being a bibliography. In the first part I simply intake and process the data.  In the second part I clean the data and determine which income factors I will be testing. And in the final part I test my chosen income factors and interpret my resutls. Here, I found the most important factors to income were education level, hours worked, weeks worked, and full-time or part-time job status.

I also performed an exercise comparing the effects of education level and race on income.  Though race was an important factor, education level was determined to be more important.
